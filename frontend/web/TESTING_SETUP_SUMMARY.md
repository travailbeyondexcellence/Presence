# Testing Setup Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

All testing infrastructure has been successfully set up for the Presence web application!

### 1. Theme-Aware Slim Scrollbar ✓
- Applied `custom-scrollbar` class to both `<html>` and `<body>` elements in `app/layout.tsx`
- The scrollbar uses CSS custom properties to adapt to the current theme
- Supports both WebKit browsers and Firefox

### 2. Package Installation ✓

**Form Validation & State Management:**
- ✅ `zod` (v4.1.12) - Schema validation library
- ✅ `zustand` (v5.0.8) - State management store

**Testing Libraries:**
- ✅ `vitest` (v4.0.3) - Fast unit test framework
- ✅ `@testing-library/react` (v16.3.0) - React component testing
- ✅ `@testing-library/jest-dom` (v6.9.1) - Custom matchers
- ✅ `@testing-library/user-event` (v14.6.1) - User interaction simulation

- Auto-start dev server before tests
- Screenshot on failure enabled

### 4. Test Scripts ✓

Added to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "test": "vitest",                    // Run unit & integration tests
  "test:watch": "vitest --watch",      // Watch mode
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",            // Visual UI
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage", // Coverage report
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",       // E2E tests
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",       // E2E with UI
  "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed", // Visible browser
  "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",  // Debug mode
  "playwright:install": "playwright install"    // Install browsers
}
```

### 5. Example Tests ✓

- Dropdown open/close behavior
- Theme selection functionality
- Keyboard navigation (ESC key)
- Outside click detection

**E2E Test** (`tests/e2e/home.spec.ts`):
- Home page load verification
- Navigation bar and footer checks
- Theme selector E2E flow
- Theme persistence after reload
- Responsive design tests (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Screenshot capture for visual verification

### 6. Documentation ✓

**Testing README** (`tests/README.md`):
- Comprehensive guide covering all three testing approaches
- Examples for each test type
- Best practices and common patterns
- Debugging instructions
- CI/CD guidance

### 7. Git Configuration ✓

Updated `.gitignore` to exclude:
- `/coverage` - Test coverage reports
- `/test-results/` - Playwright test results
- `/playwright-report/` - Playwright HTML reports
- `/tests/e2e/screenshots/` - E2E screenshots
- `*.spec.ts-snapshots/` - Visual snapshots

## 📊 Test Results

All tests are currently passing:

```
Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests       13 passed (13)
Duration    1.33s
```

**Breakdown:**
- ✅ Unit Tests: 5/5 passed (`theme-utils.test.ts`)
- ✅ Integration Tests: 8/8 passed (`ThemeSelector.test.tsx`)
- ⏳ E2E Tests: Not yet run (requires `bun playwright:install` first)

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Note:** This project uses **Bun** as the package manager and runtime.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit & Integration Tests (uses Vitest via bunx)
bun run test           # Run once
bun run test:watch     # Watch mode (recommended for development)
bun run test:ui        # Visual UI mode

# E2E Tests (first time setup)
bun run playwright:install  # Install browsers (one-time setup)
bun run test:e2e            # Run E2E tests

# E2E Tests (after setup)
bun run test:e2e:ui         # Interactive mode
bun run test:e2e:headed     # See the browser
bun run test:e2e:debug      # Debug step-by-step
```

> **Important:** Always use `bun run <script>` to ensure the proper npm script is executed.

### Important: Why `bunx --bun vitest`?

The test scripts use `bunx --bun vitest` instead of bun's built-in test runner because:
- Bun has its own test runner that conflicts with Vitest
- We need Vitest for proper jsdom environment and React Testing Library integration
- This ensures our vitest.config.ts is properly respected

### Writing New Tests

1. **For utility functions** → Add to `tests/unit/`
2. **For React components** → Add to `tests/integration/`
3. **For user flows** → Add to `tests/e2e/`

See `tests/README.md` for detailed examples and patterns.

## 🎯 Next Steps for Developers

1. **Install Playwright browsers** (first time only):
   ```bash
   bun run playwright:install
   ```

2. **Run tests in watch mode during development**:
   ```bash
   bun run test:watch
   ```

3. **Write tests for new features**:
   - Add unit tests for utilities
   - Add integration tests for components
   - Add E2E tests for critical flows

4. **Before submitting PRs**:
   ```bash
   bun run test           # Ensure unit/integration tests pass
   bun run test:e2e       # Ensure E2E tests pass
   bun run test:coverage  # Check coverage reports
   ```

## ✨ Key Features

### Zod (Form Validation)
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;
```

### Zustand (State Management)
```typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));
```

## 🎉 Summary

The testing infrastructure is fully set up and ready for use! Future developers can now:

1. Write unit tests for business logic using Vitest
2. Test React components with React Testing Library
3. Create end-to-end tests with Playwright
4. Validate forms with Zod
5. Manage global state with Zustand
6. Run tests in watch mode during development
7. Generate coverage reports
8. Debug tests easily with built-in tools

All tests are passing, and the project is ready for active development! 🚀
